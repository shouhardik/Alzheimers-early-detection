# Alzheimers-early-detection
AI model that can could analyze brain scans to identify patterns that may indicate neurological disorders. Performed data analysis, intensity normalization, image segmentation & augmentation. The CNN architecture which involved  two convolutional layers, each followed by max-pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers. The layers helped the model to capture complex patterns. The Bayesian optimization to search the hyperparameter space and maximize the modelâ€™s validation accuracy. The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with 20% of the training data used for validation.
